noblocks by Paycrest is a dApp developed for the [Onchain Summer Buildathon](https://onchain-summer.devfolio.co/). Our goal is to simplify the conversion of cryptocurrency to local currency by leveraging a decentralized liquidity protocol, we aim to provide a seamless and efficient user experience.

Check out our live demo at [noblocks.xyz](https://noblocks.xyz).

## üöÄ Running Locally

To run noblocks locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paycrest/noblocks.git
cd noblocks
npm install
npm run dev
```

Don't forget to fill in the necessary variables in the `.env.local` file according to the template provided in [`.env.example`](.env.example).

Then, visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start converting crypto to fiat.

## üìö How It Works

noblocks streamlines the conversion process through a simple flow:

1. **Create Order:** User creates an order on the [Gateway Smart Contract](https://github.com/paycrest/contracts) (escrow) through the noblocks interface.
2. **Aggregate:** Paycrest Protocol Aggregator indexes the order and assigns it to one or more [Provision Nodes](https://github.com/paycrest/provider) run by liquidity providers.
3. **Fulfill:** The provisioning node automatically disburses funds to the recipient's local bank account or mobile money wallet via connections to payment service providers (PSP).
