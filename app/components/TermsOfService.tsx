      <p>
        Paycrest, Inc. ("the Company") provides a suite of decentralized
        financial Services built on blockchain technology. Our primary offering,
        Paycrest Protocol, is a decentralized network designed to securely and

        Paycrest Protocol enables various Services to interact with a global
        decentralized financial infrastructure.

      <p>
        One of the Services built on top of Paycrest Protocol is noblocks.xyz,

        Protocol. noblocks.xyz leverages the underlying Paycrest Protocol for
        all interactions, ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency.

      <h3 className="text-base font-medium">3. Use of the Services</h3>

      <p>
        3.1 You are permitted to use the Services solely for lawful purposes and
        in compliance with these Terms. This means you agree to adhere to all
        relevant local, national, and international laws, regulations, and
        guidelines while using the Services. Specifically, you agree:
      </p>
      <p>
        a. Not to use the Services in any manner that would breach any

        or in the jurisdiction of the recipient.

      </p>
      <h3 className="text-base font-medium">4. Use of noblocks.xyz Service</h3>
      <p>
        4.1 When you initiate a transaction through the Service, your digital
        assets are transferred to a Gateway smart contract, where they are
        securely held in escrow. The assets remain in escrow until there is a
        confirmation of receipt of the equivalent funds from the payment service
        provider. Once the local currency transfer is successfully validated,
        the assets are released from escrow to a decentralized network of
        provision nodes. These nodes, which maintain reserves in local currency,
        are responsible for the transfer of value to the recipient. This ensures
        that the recipient receives their funds seamlessly, while your
        cryptocurrency remains secure until the process is complete.
      </p>
      <p>4.2 Transaction Timing</p>
      <p>
        Transactions initiated through the Service are typically completed
        within 30 seconds. However, actual completion times may vary due to
        factors beyond the Company’s control, such as network congestion,
        variations in blockchain confirmation times, or unforeseen delays within
        the peer-to-peer network. While the Service is designed to enable rapid
        transactions, these external factors may occasionally cause delays.
      </p>
      <p>4.3 Transaction Limits and Refunds</p>
      <p>
        While the Service does not enforce specific transaction limits,
        successful completion of transactions is contingent upon the
        availability of sufficient liquidity across the network of provision
        nodes. If the liquidity necessary to complete a transaction is
        unavailable at the time of execution, the cryptocurrency escrowed for
        the transaction will be promptly refunded to your wallet. The Company
        makes no guarantees regarding the availability of liquidity and shall
        not be liable for any delays or interruptions resulting from
        insufficient liquidity.
      </p>
      <p>4.4 Value Conversion</p>
      <p>
        The value applied to your transaction is determined at the moment of
        conversion from digital assets to local value. This value is calculated
        based on the current market conditions and rates provided by the
        providers in the network. Please be aware that value can change rapidly
        due to market dynamics, such as supply and demand, economic events, and
        regulatory updates. While the Company strives to use accurate and
        current rates, we do not control market fluctuations that may occur
        between the initiation of a transaction and its completion.
        Consequently, the Company cannot guarantee that the value applied will
        be the most favorable or advantageous to the User. The User acknowledges
        and accepts that the value of digital assets may vary significantly in
        short periods, and the Company is not liable for any losses or perceived
        disadvantages resulting from these fluctuations. Additionally, once the
        transaction is initiated, the value applied is final and cannot be
        contested or adjusted.
      </p>
      <p>4.4 Costs and Donations</p>
      <p>
        The Service is designed to be free to use. However, the Company may
        collect contributions to support the ongoing operation and development
        of the Services. Any contributions required for using the Services,
        including transaction-related costs, will be clearly disclosed to you
        before you complete each transaction. This ensures that you are fully
        informed of any potential costs associated with your transaction before
        proceeding. The Company reserves the right to adjust these contributions
        at any time, with or without notice.

      </p>
      <p>5.4 Limitations and Liability</p>
      <p>
        The Company is not liable for any actions or omissions by Providers.
        Providers are solely responsible for the quality of their services and
        any issues arising from their operations. The Company disclaims any
        responsibility for losses or damages resulting from Provider actions.
      </p>
      <p>5.5 Termination and Suspension</p>
      <p>
        The Company reserves the right to terminate or suspend the engagement of
        any Provider that fails to comply with these Terms or engages in conduct
        that is detrimental to the Service. Such actions may be taken at the

        verification services, play a critical role in ensuring that the digital
        assets you send are converted into the recipient’s local value,
        delivered appropriately, and that all necessary identity verification
        processes are completed.
      </p>
      <p>
        b. While the Company strives to collaborate with reliable and
        trustworthy third-party providers, you acknowledge and agree that the
        Company cannot control, and is not responsible for, the actions,
        decisions, or omissions of these third party providers.. This includes

        conversion, fund transfers, or identity verification processes due to
        third-party involvement. By using the Services, you accept the inherent
        risks associated with third-party providers and agree that the Company

      </p>

        or security breach involving your digital assets, whether caused by user
        error or third-party actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.4 Paycrest Protocol allows independent entities to interact within the
        network by performing tasks related to the service. These entities
        operate independently and must comply with legal requirements in their
        respective locations. The Company is not responsible for the actions or
        failures of these entities within the network.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.5 All transactions through Paycrest Protocol are irreversible once
        confirmed on the blockchain. Users must ensure the accuracy of their
        payment details before initiating any actions, as the Company cannot
        intervene or alter transactions after they are confirmed.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.6 Paycrest Protocol is not registered with the U.S. Securities and
        Exchange Commission (SEC) or any other regulatory body, as it does not
        handle or manage user funds, custody assets, or facilitate any financial
        transactions. The Protocol operates as a decentralized network, where
        independent entities perform actions, and users maintain full control
        over their own assets. The Company does not engage in activities that
        would require registration with financial regulatory authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.7 Paycrest Protocol may impose fees for using the network, which are
        applied to transactions routed through the Protocol. These fees are
        determined by the Protocol's governance and are transparent, with the
        exact amount disclosed at the time a transaction request is submitted.
        The fees may vary depending on the network's conditions, operational
        costs, and other factors, but users will always have the opportunity to
        review and approve any applicable fees before proceeding with a
        transaction. The Company reserves the right to adjust the fee structure
        over time, but any changes will be clearly communicated through the
        relevant channels to ensure transparency.

        9. Security Measures and User Responsibility
      </h3>
      <p>
        9.1 The Company is committed to ensuring robust security for users and
        their transactions. Since our Services operate through cryptocurrency
        wallets, rather than traditional account setups, users must take
        specific steps to safeguard their wallets and transactions. These steps
        include:
      </p>
      <p className="pl-3">
        a. Wallet Security: Keep your cryptocurrency wallet private keys and
        recovery phrases confidential. Do not share this information with
        anyone, as it is essential for accessing and managing your funds.
        <br />
        b. Strong Security Practices: Use strong, unique passwords for your
        wallet Services, and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever
        possible.
        <br />
        c. Regular Monitoring: Frequently review your wallet and transaction
        history for any signs of unauthorized activity.
        <br />
        d. Phishing Awareness: Be cautious of phishing attempts and ensure that
        any communication requesting sensitive information is verified. The
        Company will never request your wallet keys or personal information
        through unsolicited messages.
        <br />
        e. Reporting Suspicious Activity: If you suspect any unauthorized access
        or suspicious activity involving your wallet, notify the Company
        immediately. While we strive to protect your data, no system can be
        entirely immune to security risks.
      </p>
      <p>
        9.2 You acknowledge that, despite our best efforts to enhance security,
        the ultimate responsibility for safeguarding your wallet and
        transactions lies with you.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-base font-medium">10. Limitation of Liability</h3>

        <br />
        e. The Company does not guarantee that the Services will be free from
        viruses, malware, or other harmful components. While the Company

        against security threats.
        <br />
        f. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that the Company is
        not liable for any issues or problems that may arise from the use of the

        applies regardless of the cause of action, whether based on contract,
        tort (including negligence), strict liability, or any other legal
        theory, and even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of
        such damages. Specifically, the Company will not be liable for:

        Association (AAA). The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in

        a. You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Services
        adheres to all applicable local laws, regulations, and guidelines. b.

      </p>
      <p>
        11.4 Waiver of Class Actions and Jury Trial: You agree that any disputes

        14.1 These Terms, along with the Privacy Policy and any other legal
        notices or policies that the Company may publish on the Services,
        represent the complete and exclusive understanding and agreement between

        and replace any prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings,
        communications, or proposals, whether oral or written, between you and

        whether they are part of past discussions, emails, or any other

      <p>
        If any provision of these Terms is determined by a court of competent
        jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason,
        that provision will be deemed severed from the rest of these Terms.
        However, this severance will not affect the validity and enforceability

        effect.

      <p>14.3 Waiver</p>

        other term. Furthermore, if the Company chooses not to enforce any right
        or provision of these Terms at any time, this decision shall not be
        interpreted as a waiver of the Company’s right to enforce that provision
        or any other provision in the future. Each provision remains fully
        enforceable unless expressly waived in writing by the Company.
